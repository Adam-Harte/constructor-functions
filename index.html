    <h1>Constructor Functions</h1>
    <p>
      Constructor functions are a way for us to define blueprints for objects
      with methods and prooerties the same way we use classes and also the same
      way we define them with the new keyword used to create instances. Behind
      the scenes classes are converted to these constructor functions as this is
      the original method that existed to create object blueprints before the
      class syntax was available.

    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
    <p>
      Prototypes are connected objects in JavaScript wihc act as fallbakcks for
      objects. JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance meaning objects inherit
      prototypes from the classes/objects they extend starting from the global
      Object, then type objects e.g. Array, String etc. and so on. You can see
      prototypes of objects via the __proto__ property. Constructor functions
      also have a prototype property which points to the exact same object in
      memory as __proto__ and is used to define a new prototype and therefore
      overrite the __proto__ for every object we create based on that
      constructor function.
